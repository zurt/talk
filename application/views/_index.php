				<h3>Why private messaging?</h3>
				<p>Email is great.  But there are a lot of things emails can't do well -- and that's where Cheep comes in.</p>
				<p>It's a place to put messages, links, pictures and videos that you want to share and talk about with a small group of people.  Cheep makes talking with groups online simple.</p>
				<p>Fire it up, give it a whirl and let us know what you think!  Go on and <a href="/auth/register">join now</a>.</p>
