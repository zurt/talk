				<h3>Why private messaging?</h3>
				<p>Email is great.  But there are a lot of things emails can't do well -- like long-form group conversations.  that's where Cheep comes in.</p>
				<p>We want to make talking with groups of people online easy and fun.  It might be family vacation planning, event organization or even just trading cool links.</p>
				<p>Fire it up, give it a whirl and let us know what you think!  Go on and <a href="/auth/login/">join now</a>.</p>
