				<h3>Why private messaging?</h3>
				<p>Email is great.  But there are a lot of things emails can't do well -- and that's where Jabberlap comes in.</p>
				<p>It's a place to put messages, links, pictures and videos that you want to share and talk about with a small group of people.  Jabberlap makes talking with groups online simple.</p>
				<p>Fire it up, give it a whirl and let us know what you think!  Go on and <a href="/auth/register">join now</a>.</p>
				<p>(If you have more questions, feel free to check our <a href="/about/">about</a> page as well, they might be answered there.)</p>
