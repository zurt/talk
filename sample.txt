Will anyone be able to see this once they join?
Indeed they will.
Nice picture, nerd.
No way to break this out into separate topics yet?
Make a new group. No topics.
Also, doesn't auto update yet
I am experimenting with posting media. This will be very interesting once there are more features. I think I need more groups, too to see how easy this is to navigate when it is busier. Also, I need my friends (other than Tripp) to join!
bebeh goats!
but seriously, more kitties
We made salsa this afternoon with heirloom tomatoes from the farmer's market and jalape√±os from the backyard. Yum.
And for lunch we made arugula, fresh corn and soyrizo salad with avocado and lemon cucumbers.
Those both sound amazing! I have mostly eaten Doritos this weekend, which is so NOT amazing
I gave in and had Tripp attach the antennae and am watching Olympics. USA!
watch out, you'll become an addict. i watched more tv last week than i had probably watched in the past year. damn you, swimming!
want to watch tonight? it turns out we get perfect reception!
